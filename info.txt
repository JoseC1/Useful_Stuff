The Vim editor enables you to define your own commands. You execute these commands just like any other Command-line mode command. To define a command, use the ":command" command, as follows:

:command DeleteFirst 1delete

Now when you execute the command ":DeleteFirst" Vim executes ":1delete", which deletes the first line.

Note: User-defined commands must start with a capital letter. You cannot use ":X", ":Next" and ":Print". The underscore cannot be used! You can use digits, but this is discouraged.
